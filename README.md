# Loyd-s-Puzzle
Modeling Loyd's Puzzle (3x3) using NuSMV


There is an array *h* that keeps track of the horizontal positions of the tiles and an array *v* that keeps track of the vertical positions of the tiles such that the position of tile *i* is given by pair *h[i]*,*v[i]*.Tile *0* represents
the blank tile. Position *h[i] = 1* and *v[i] = 1* is the lowest left corner of the puzzle.

Here, we define the action *move* with reference to Tile *0* (i.e) the actions *up,down,left & right* are defined for Tile 0.
Suppose, if Tile *1* is to the left of Tile *0*, the move *left* results in Tile *0* moving **left** and Tile *1* moving **right**.

Please write the rest Aneesha. I think the rest is about the conditions for Tile 0 & Tile 1
